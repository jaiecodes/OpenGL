## Learning OpenGL
This is a side project to learn the graphics API OpenGL. Information is primarily learned from the online book "Learn OpenGL: Learn modern OpenGL graphics programming" by  Joey de Vries

Current progress consists of making a 3D object with textures and a colorful fragment shader that rotates in a single spot.
